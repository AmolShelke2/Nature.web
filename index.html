      <h1>Welcome to Beach</h1>
      <p>
        There’s nothing like a relaxing day at the beach to soak up all your
        worries. Just closing your eyes and imagining the soft sand caressing
        your toes as gentle waves lap the shore and the sun shines.
      </p>

        Sandy Most beach sand comes from several different sources. Some sand
        may be eroded bits of a rocky reef just offshore. Others may be eroded
        rock from nearby cliffs. Pensacola Beach, in the U.S. state of Florida,
        for instance, has white, sandy beaches. Some sand is eroded from rocks
        and minerals in the Gulf of Mexico. Most sand, however, is made of tiny
        particles of weathered quartz from the Appalachian Mountains, hundreds
        of kilometers away.

        Other types of beaches Some beaches, called barrier beaches, protect the
        mainland from the battering of ocean waves. These beaches may lie at the
        heads of islands called barrier islands. Many barrier beaches and
        barrier islands stretch along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United
        States. These narrow beaches form barriers between the open ocean and
        protected harbors, lagoons, and sounds. Beaches near rivers are often
        muddy or soft. Soil and sediment from the river is carried to the
        river’s mouth, sometimes creating a fertile beach. Hoi An, Vietnam, is
        an ancient town that sits on the estuary of the Thu Bon River and the
        South China Sea. Hoi An’s soft beaches serve as resort and tourist
        center.

        Coastal Erosion The most significant threat to beaches is natural
        coastal erosion. Coastal erosion is the natural process of the beach
        moving due to waves, storms, and wind.

        Hurricane Sandy was a deadly storm that struck the East Coast of the
        United States in October 2012. Many of the seawalls of Sea Gate
        crumbled, and more than 25 homes were lost.

        Sea Level Rise Beaches are also threatened by sea level rise. Sea levels
        have been gradually rising for many years, drowning some beaches
        completely.
